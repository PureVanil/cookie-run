                            The history of Cookie Run: Ovenbreak.
                            <br> There were three Ovenbreak games that were
                            made through the years by Devsisters. Ovenbreak was
                            the first game to be released by Devsisters on June 15, 2009.
                            Ovenbreak can referred to many other names like, Ovenbreak Lite,
                            Ovenbreak: Gingerbrave Run, Ovenbreak Infinity, or Ovenbreak Skittles.
                            It was an endless arcade style game and has multiple different modes.
                            On December 11, 2012, the devs released a sequel to Ovenbreak, 
                            Ovenbreak 2. Devsisters then release Cookie Run: Ovenbreak on
                            September 26, 2016 in Canada, Sweden, Netherlands, Philippines,
                            Hong Kong, and Australia. They has a pre-registration event that
                            is no longer active. On October 27 of 2016, the game released globally
                            except China. It was the first game that they have released since
                            the launch on LINE Cookie Run on January 2014, and marks the departure
                            of the usage of LINE and Kakao, which were instant messaging platforms.
